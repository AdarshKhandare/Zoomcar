# **Zoomcar.com Website Clone**
Hi reader!‚úåÔ∏è

We are creating this blog to share our experience of our first project as part of construct week at Masai School. The project assigned to our group was a clone of Zoomcar, which is India‚Äôs first and largest online self-drive car rental company


Our team consists of 5 people including Me, Pankaj Kumar, Aditi Hinge, Govind Lakhotiya, and Rav Chandan Kumar.


# [Live Project](https://myntra-clone-unitfour.herokuapp.com/).

# **Our Expectations**
We are expecting to create a pixel-perfect cloned site of the Zoomcar website, with all its pages, giving proper HTML, CSS properties, using DOM concepts with respect to the official Zoomcar website, and also demonstrating a basic flow of booking a car, where a customer can view the car, filter them as per their requirements, read about specification, start his or her happy journeyüòä.

# **TECHNOLOGY STACK WE USED**
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript(Dom and local storage)


# **Roles and responsibilities**
